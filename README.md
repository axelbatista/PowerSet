Modify the up to what counter to have powersets done for numbers ranging from 1 to up to what.
While being something I just wanted to do just cause, I have found this to be very useful in solving multiple choice
questions with multiple answers in the event that you have multiple guesses. If you can't figure out the answer but need the
points, this is a good tool to fall back onto as you can get all possible answer choices no matter the number of choices.
While not done here, you can just change the Up to What count up to the highest possible answer choice (such as 3 for A B C)
and then you can also change the printing such that it does something like 'A' + i when going to another stage for example.
Have this done for something else, but this one in particular was just me implementing the idea I saw in my Discrete Structures class.
Formatting is also kinda wonky here as in the permutation calculator one with the count on the side.
